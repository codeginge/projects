'''
this code simulates the engigma machine and its series of encryptions. the code will 
visualize the text as each encryption/decryption takes place. just like the real machine, 
you put in either plain text or cypher text and if the machine is set correctly your 
message will be encoded or decoded just like it was back in WWII. 

EXAMPLE USAGE:
# build env
python3 -m venv myenv_enigma
source myenv_enigma/bin/activate 
pip install

# run
python3 ./enigma.py "<input_text>" "<plugboard_pairs>" "<reflector>" "<rotor_positions>" 
			"<rotor1_#>" "<rotor2_#>" "<rotor3_#>" "<rotor4_#>" "<encrypt_decrypt_speed>"
