Overview of "Designing Authentic Performance Tasks and Projects" – Jay McTighe & Kristina Doubet
This book focuses on creating meaningful assessments that go beyond traditional testing by emphasizing real-world applications of knowledge. It provides guidelines for designing performance tasks and projects that measure students’ deeper understanding rather than just surface-level recall.

Key Takeaways from the Book
Shift from Traditional Assessments to Performance-Based Tasks

Instead of multiple-choice tests or rote assignments, students demonstrate their understanding through projects, case studies, or real-world problem-solving.
Backward Design (Understanding by Design - UbD)

Start with the end goal in mind (what mastery looks like) and design assessments first, ensuring alignment with learning objectives.
Essential Components of Performance Tasks

Authenticity: The task should mirror real-world challenges (e.g., designing a bridge for an engineering class rather than just solving equations).
Student Role: Students take on authentic roles (e.g., a scientist, an engineer, a policymaker).
Audience: The task should involve an authentic audience, not just the teacher (e.g., presenting findings to a local environmental board).
Purpose & Impact: Students should see the real-world value of their learning.
Criteria for Effective Performance Tasks

Clear learning targets tied to competencies/mastery standards.
An open-ended problem that allows for multiple solutions.
Opportunities for student choice and creativity.
A rubric with clear criteria for mastery.
The Role of Feedback & Iteration

Mastery-based learning requires multiple attempts at a task with structured feedback loops.
Students should reflect on their performance, revise, and resubmit.
Key Variables to Track in a Mastery-Based LMS
If designing a learning resource (like an LMS) based on these principles, McTighe & Doubet would likely suggest tracking:

Competency Progression

Which skills/standards has the student mastered?
Where are they struggling?
How many attempts did it take to reach mastery?
Engagement & Interaction

How much time does a student spend on each task?
Are they engaging with feedback and revising work?
Are they making connections between concepts?
Authenticity & Application

Has the student applied concepts in real-world contexts?
Are they demonstrating understanding, or just repeating information?
Assessment Types & Depth of Knowledge (DOK)

Are tasks at a higher cognitive level (application, analysis, synthesis) rather than just recall?
Are students completing different types of assessments (projects, case studies, discussions)?
Feedback & Revision History

How frequently does the student revise their work?
Are they incorporating teacher and peer feedback into improvements?
Student Autonomy & Choice

Does the student have options in how they demonstrate mastery?
Are they taking initiative in their learning process?
Collaboration & Communication

Are students engaging in peer discussions or collaborative projects?
Are they able to articulate their understanding clearly?

In addition to projects, mastery-based grading often includes a variety of assessments that allow students multiple ways to demonstrate understanding and growth. Some common assessment types include:

1. Formative Assessments (Low-Stakes, Frequent)
These assessments help gauge progress and provide immediate feedback without penalizing students for mistakes.

Quizzes with Retakes – Students can attempt quizzes multiple times, with feedback guiding improvements.
Exit Tickets – Short reflections or concept checks at the end of a lesson.
Concept Maps & Graphic Organizers – Students visually demonstrate their understanding of relationships between concepts.
Think-Alouds – Students explain their reasoning while solving problems.
2. Performance-Based Assessments
These require students to apply their knowledge in authentic ways, similar to projects but often smaller in scale.

Case Studies & Problem-Solving Tasks – Students analyze real-world problems and propose solutions.
Simulations & Lab Work – Hands-on activities that measure practical application.
Coding Challenges (for Tech/Engineering) – Timed or untimed coding tasks to assess problem-solving strategies.
3. Written & Verbal Assessments
Students explain concepts rather than just solve problems.

Journals & Reflections – Self-assessment on learning progress.
Essay Responses – Deeper analysis of concepts and their applications.
Oral Explanations – Students verbally explain how they approached a problem or project.
4. Peer & Self-Assessments
These help students reflect on their learning and understand assessment criteria.

Self-Scoring with Rubrics – Students assess their own work before submission.
Peer Reviews – Structured feedback from classmates using mastery-based criteria.
5. Portfolio-Based Assessment
A collection of student work over time, showing progress toward mastery.

Digital or Physical Portfolios – Includes projects, reflections, and assessments to track improvement.
